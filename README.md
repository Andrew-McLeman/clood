*Clood CBR: Towards Microservices Oriented Case-Based Reasoning*

# What is Clood? 
*(its **Cloud** in Scottish dialect)*


Case-based Reasoning (CBR) applications have been deployed in a wide range of sectors, from pharmaceuticals; to defence and aerospace to IoT and transportation, to poetry and music generation; for example. However, a majority of CBR applications have been built using monolithic architectures which impose size and complexity constraints. As such these applications have a barrier to adopting new technologies and remain prohibitively expensive in both time and cost because changes in frameworks or languages affect the application directly. To address this challenge, we developed a distributed and highly scalable generic CBR system, Clood, which is based on a microservices architecture. This splits the application into a set of smaller, interconnected services that scale to meet varying demands. Microservices are cloud-native architectures and with the rapid increase in cloud-computing adoption, it is timely for the CBR community to have access to such a framework.

## Project Components

### Implementation Architecture

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGU-Computing/clood/master/images/clood_architecture.jpg">

## Clood Structure and Technologies
- Serverless Functions - REST API for communication from client apps (Serverless Framework with Python functions)
- Client - This is the demonstration dashboard (AngularJS)
- Elasticsearch - Managed ES service used as casebase 

### Serverless Functions

Project is available in the ```serverless-functions``` folder of the repository.

### Elasticsearch
For the Clood implementation we have used [AWS Elasticsearch service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/).

## Start Using Clood? üöÄ

### Local Development

We have simplified the entire CloodCBR development environment. You can easily start developing Clood CBR using the containarised environment now. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  installed.

Once cloned this repo you just have to run the following commands

Copy the default Configuration files:
```
cp dashboard/app/env.sample.js dashboard/app/env.js && cp api/config.sample.py api/config.py
```

Create the docker containers and run
```
docker compose up --build
```

Development Ports

- CloodCBR Dashboard - [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- CloodCBR API - [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- OpenSearch Dashboard - [http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601/)
- OpenSearch API - [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/)
- Clood USE Vectoriser API - [http://localhost:4100/](http://localhost:4100/)

### Deployment
### OpenSearch (Formerly ElasticSearch in AWS) 
Follow the guide [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html) on getting started with Elasticsearch in AWS. All you need next is the ES url and the AWS access keys.

### Serverless functions (API)

We have built Clood with the [serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework which is a used deploy and test serverless apps across different cloud providers. The example installation here will be for AWS.

1. Make sure you have installed and setup serverless framework globally. [Guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

2. Install Dependenices from CLI
```
npm install
```

3. Update the serverless.yml file as required. (Eg. region, service name..)

4. Add a conf.py file with the following structure

```python
aws = {
    "host": 'CLOUDSEARCH AWS URL', # domain.eu-west-1.es.amazonaws.com
    "region": 'eu-west-1',
    "access_key":   '',
    "secret_key": ''
}
```

4. Simply deploy now, it will package and run in CLI
```
serverless deploy
```

* Make sure that [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is running in your computer when deploying (it is required to package the python dependencies)

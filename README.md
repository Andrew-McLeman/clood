*Clood CBR: Towards Microservices Oriented Case-Based Reasoning*

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0.0-brightgreen" alt="Version"/>

### üöÄ Version 2 Released!


# What is Clood? 
*(its **Cloud** in Scottish dialect)*


Case-based Reasoning (CBR) applications have been widely deployed across various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, defense, aerospace, IoT, transportation, poetry, and music generation. However, a significant proportion of these applications have been developed using monolithic architectures, which present size and complexity constraints. Consequently, these applications face barriers to the adoption of new technologies, and changes in frameworks or languages directly impact them, making them prohibitively expensive in terms of time and cost. To tackle this challenge, **we have developed Clood CBR, a distributed and highly scalable generic CBR system based on a microservices architecture.** By splitting the application into smaller, interconnected services, Clood CBR can scale to meet varying demands. Microservices are cloud-native architectures that have become increasingly popular with the rapid adoption of cloud computing. Therefore, the CBR community can benefit from a framework such as Clood CBR at this opportune time.

## Project Components

### Implementation Architecture

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGU-Computing/clood/master/images/clood_architecture.jpg">

## Clood Structure and Technologies
- Serverless Functions - REST API for communication from client apps (Serverless Framework with Python functions)
- Client - This is the demonstration dashboard (AngularJS)
- Elasticsearch - Managed ES service used as casebase 

### Serverless Functions

Project is available in the ```serverless-functions``` folder of the repository.

### Elasticsearch
For the Clood implementation we have used [AWS Elasticsearch service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/).

## Start Using Clood? üöÄ

### Local Development

We have simplified the entire CloodCBR development environment. You can easily start developing Clood CBR using the containarised environment now. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  installed.

Once cloned this repo you just have to run the following commands

Copy the default Configuration files:
```
cp dashboard/app/env.sample.js dashboard/app/env.js && cp api/config.sample.py api/config.py && cp other-services/ontology-sim/config.sample.py other-services/ontology-sim/config.py && cp other-services/semantic-sim/config.sample.py other-services/semantic-sim/config.py
```

Create the docker containers and run
```
docker compose up --build
```

Development Ports

- CloodCBR Dashboard - [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- CloodCBR API - [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- OpenSearch Dashboard - [http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601/)
- OpenSearch API - [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/)
- Clood USE Vectoriser API - [http://localhost:4100/](http://localhost:4100/)

### Deployment
### OpenSearch (Formerly ElasticSearch in AWS) 
Follow the guide [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html) on getting started with Elasticsearch in AWS. All you need next is the ES url and the AWS access keys.

### Serverless functions (API)

We have built Clood with the [serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework which is a used deploy and test serverless apps across different cloud providers. The example installation here will be for AWS.

1. Make sure you have installed and setup serverless framework globally. [Guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

2. Install Dependenices from CLI
```
npm install
```

3. Update the serverless.yml file as required. (Eg. region, service name..)

4. Add a conf.py file with the following structure

```python
aws = {
    "host": 'CLOUDSEARCH AWS URL', # domain.eu-west-1.es.amazonaws.com
    "region": 'eu-west-1',
    "access_key":   '',
    "secret_key": ''
}
```

4. Simply deploy now, it will package and run in CLI
```
serverless deploy
```

* Make sure that [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is running in your computer when deploying (it is required to package the python dependencies)
